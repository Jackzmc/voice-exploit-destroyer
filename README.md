# zeko-v3

A better implementation of [Caeden117/VCMuteExploitDetectionBot](https://github.com/Caeden117/VCMuteExploitDetectionBot) built on discord.js & Typescript (using my own template Jackzmc/zeko-v3)

All you need is to set these 3 environment variables

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
MONITOR_CHANNELS= # comma separated list of channel IDS
MONITOR_JOIN_CHANNEL=  #ID of the voice channel the bot should join, needed to monitor a guild

#Optionally:
#BOT_PREFIX=
#ACTION_MODE=DISCONNECT  # Either BAN or DISCONNECT or KICK (from server)
#ACTION_REASON="Mute Speaking Exploit" # The action reason the bot will use
```
